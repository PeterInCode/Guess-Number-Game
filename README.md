# Guess Number Game
This is a simple Python program where the user tries to guess a randomly chosen number within 5 attempts.

## How It Works
1. The program selects a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The user has 5 attempts to guess the correct number.
3. After each guess, the game will provide feedback:
  - "Too low!" if the guess is lower than the target number.
  - "Too high!" if the guess is higher than the target number.
  - "Congratulations!" if the guess is correct.
